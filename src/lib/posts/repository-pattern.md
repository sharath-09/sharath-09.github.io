## The Journey to Understanding Go Project Structure

During my journey learning Go, I enjoyed discovering the elegance of its syntax and the powerful capabilities provided by the standard library. However, there was one aspect that took me longer than usual to grasp: understanding how to properly structure a Go project.

As I dove deeper into developing my first full-stack application with Go, I found myself grappling with architectural decisions that seemed straightforward in other languages but felt foreign in the Go ecosystem. Coming from a Python background, I had grown accustomed to the flexibility and speed afforded by loose rules and dynamic typing. Python's frameworks often provide opinionated structures that guide you toward certain patterns, but Go takes a different approach—it gives you the building blocks but leaves the architecture largely up to you.

## The Confusion of Choice

This freedom, while powerful, initially left me confused. I tried studying popular open-source Go projects, hoping to find a canonical structure I could follow. Instead, I discovered that each project had its own unique structure and philosophy. Some organized by feature, others by layer, and still others by domain. The famous [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) repository provided a good starting point, but it addressed the physical layout of directories rather than the conceptual organization of code responsibilities.

I needed to understand not just _where_ to put my code, but _how_ to design the interactions between different parts of my application in a way that felt natural in Go.

## The Moment of Clarity

The breakthrough came unexpectedly one evening while I was having dinner and watching a video by the YouTuber Tiago Temporin, [Repository Pattern in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE8nqgryW_8). Something about his explanation resonated with me, and suddenly the pieces fell into place.

The core idea is simple yet powerful: **separate everything into interfaces, and allow those interfaces to communicate with each other**. This approach creates loose coupling between the different layers of your application—typically the presentation layer, business logic (service) layer, and data access layer. By defining contracts through interfaces rather than concrete implementations, you gain modularity, testability, and the flexibility to swap implementations without rippling changes throughout your codebase.

## Why It Felt Unnatural at First

I'll be honest—this pattern didn't feel intuitive immediately, especially coming from an object-oriented programming mindset. In traditional OOP languages like Python or Java, you might be inclined to create concrete classes that directly depend on other concrete classes. The repository pattern in Go, however, embraces composition over inheritance and dependency injection through interfaces.

Once it clicked, though, I understood the strength behind this approach. By programming to interfaces, you're not just making your code more testable (though that's a significant benefit). You're also creating natural boundaries between different concerns of your application. Your business logic doesn't need to know, or care, where or how the data is stored, it just knows it can call methods on some abstract data store implementation.

## The Origins: Domain-Driven Design

This realization led me to dig deeper into the theoretical foundations of the pattern. I discovered that the repository pattern has its roots in **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, a software design approach introduced by Eric Evans in his book, _Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software_.

In DDD, a repository is defined as a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects. The key insight is that your domain layer (business logic) should remain pure and focused on business rules, while the repository acts as a mediator between the domain and data mapping layers.

## Anatomy of the Repository Pattern in Go

Let's break down how this pattern typically manifests in a Go application:

### 1. The Domain Layer

This is where your business entities and core business logic live. These structs represent the concepts that matter to your business domain:

```go
type User struct {
    ID        string
    Email     string
    Name      string
    CreatedAt time.Time
}
```

### 2. The Repository Interface

This interface defines the contract for data operations without specifying how they're implemented:

```go
type UserRepository interface {
    Create(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    GetByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (*User, error)
    GetByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (*User, error)
    Update(ctx context.Context, user *User) error
    Delete(ctx context.Context, id string) error
}
```

### 3. The Concrete Repository Implementation

This is where you implement the actual data access logic for a specific storage mechanism:

```go
type PostgresUserRepository struct {
    db *sql.DB
}

func (r *PostgresUserRepository) Create(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    // PostgreSQL-specific implementation
    query := `INSERT INTO users (id, email, name, created_at) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)`
    _, err := r.db.ExecContext(ctx, query, user.ID, user.Email, user.Name, user.CreatedAt)
    return err
}

// ... other methods
```

### 4. The Service Layer

This layer contains your business logic and depends only on the repository interface, not the concrete implementation:

```go
type UserService struct {
    repo UserRepository
}

func NewUserService(repo UserRepository) *UserService {
    return &UserService{repo: repo}
}

func (s *UserService) RegisterUser(ctx context.Context, email, name string) (*User, error) {
    // Business logic: check if user exists
    existing, err := s.repo.GetByEmail(ctx, email)
    if err == nil && existing != nil {
        return nil, errors.New("user already exists")
    }

    // Create new user
    user := &User{
        ID:        uuid.New().String(),
        Email:     email,
        Name:      name,
        CreatedAt: time.Now(),
    }

    if err := s.repo.Create(ctx, user); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return user, nil
}
```

## The Benefits I've Experienced

Since adopting this pattern, I've noticed several concrete benefits in my Go projects:

### Testability

Testing becomes significantly easier because you can create mock implementations of your repositories for unit testing your service layer:

```go
type MockUserRepository struct {
    users map[string]*User
}

func (m *MockUserRepository) Create(ctx context.Context, user *User) error {
    m.users[user.ID] = user
    return nil
}

// ... other mock methods
```

### Flexibility

Need to switch from PostgreSQL to MongoDB? Or add a caching layer? You only need to create a new implementation of your repository interface—your service layer remains untouched.

### Separation of Concerns

Each layer has a clear responsibility. Your HTTP handlers deal with HTTP concerns, services handle business logic, and repositories manage data persistence. This separation makes the codebase easier to navigate and reason about.

### Parallel Development

Different team members can work on different layers simultaneously. Someone can implement the service logic while another person works on the repository implementation, as long as they agree on the interface contract.

## Conclusion

The repository pattern, grounded in Domain-Driven Design principles, has transformed how I approach building Go applications. While it may seem like additional complexity at first—especially if you're coming from a background where concrete dependencies are the norm—the benefits of loose coupling, testability, and maintainability quickly become apparent as your application grows.

The pattern aligns beautifully with Go's philosophy of simplicity and composition. By embracing interfaces and dependency injection, you create flexible, modular applications that are easier to test, extend, and maintain over time.

If you're struggling with Go project structure like I was, I encourage you to explore the repository pattern. Watch that Tiago Temporin video, experiment with separating your layers through interfaces, and see if it clicks for you the way it did for me. Sometimes, the best architectural insights come when you're least expecting them—even over dinner.
